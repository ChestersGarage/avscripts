# A/V Scripts
A place for the scripts I write for my audio/video projects.

# Usage
* Put this repo somewhere convenient.
* Add it to your PATH environment variable.
* Run in the folder you want the OUTPUT to be placed.

I recommend always running in an empty folder, and reference your source files where they are.
